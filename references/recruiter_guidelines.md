# Technical Resume Guidelines - Recruiter & Engineering Manager Perspective

## Core Principles

### The 6-Second Rule
Recruiters spend an average of 6 seconds on initial resume screening. Your resume must communicate impact immediately.

### Results Over Responsibilities
Show what you achieved, not just what you did. Every bullet should answer: "So what? What was the impact?"

## Content Structure

### Professional Summary (Optional)
- 2-3 sentences maximum
- Lead with years of experience and key expertise
- Focus on value proposition, not generic statements
- Example: "Senior Software Engineer with 7+ years building scalable distributed systems. Led migration serving 50M+ users with 99.99% uptime."

### Work Experience

#### Company & Role Information
- Company name, location, dates (Month Year - Month Year)
- Job title
- Brief company context if not well-known (e.g., "Early-stage fintech startup, Series A")

#### Bullet Points - The XYZ Formula
Use the formula: **Accomplished [X] as measured by [Y] by doing [Z]**

**Strong Examples:**
- Reduced API latency by 40% (from 200ms to 120ms) by implementing Redis caching layer and optimizing database queries
- Increased user retention by 25% by redesigning onboarding flow based on A/B testing across 100K users
- Led team of 5 engineers to deliver payment system processing $2M daily transactions with zero downtime during 6-month migration

**Weak Examples (Avoid):**
- Worked on improving system performance ❌ (No metrics, vague)
- Responsible for backend development ❌ (Responsibility, not achievement)
- Helped team with various tasks ❌ (Unclear impact, weak verb)

#### Action Verbs by Category

**Leadership & Initiative:**
Led, Spearheaded, Directed, Drove, Championed, Established, Pioneered

**Technical Achievement:**
Architected, Engineered, Designed, Implemented, Optimized, Built, Developed, Migrated

**Impact & Results:**
Reduced, Increased, Improved, Accelerated, Eliminated, Streamlined, Scaled, Achieved

**Collaboration:**
Collaborated, Partnered, Coordinated (use sparingly - focus on YOUR impact)

### Quantifiable Metrics That Matter

**Scale Metrics:**
- Users impacted (e.g., "50M monthly active users")
- Transactions processed (e.g., "$10M daily transaction volume")
- Data volume (e.g., "Processing 5TB daily")
- Request rate (e.g., "10K requests/second")

**Performance Metrics:**
- Latency improvements (e.g., "Reduced p99 latency from 500ms to 50ms")
- Throughput increases (e.g., "Increased throughput by 3x")
- Cost savings (e.g., "Reduced infrastructure costs by $200K annually")
- Error rate reductions (e.g., "Decreased error rate from 2% to 0.1%")

**Team & Delivery Metrics:**
- Team size led (e.g., "Led team of 8 engineers")
- Project timeline (e.g., "Delivered 3 months ahead of schedule")
- Code quality (e.g., "Increased test coverage from 40% to 85%")

**Business Impact:**
- Revenue impact (e.g., "Feature drove $2M in annual revenue")
- User growth (e.g., "Contributed to 300% user growth")
- Conversion improvements (e.g., "Improved conversion rate by 15%")

## Technical Skills Section

### Organization
Group skills by category:
- **Languages:** Python, Go, JavaScript, TypeScript, Java
- **Frameworks:** React, Node.js, Django, FastAPI
- **Infrastructure:** AWS (EC2, S3, Lambda), Kubernetes, Docker, Terraform
- **Databases:** PostgreSQL, MongoDB, Redis, DynamoDB
- **Tools:** Git, Jenkins, DataDog, Grafana

### Best Practices
- List skills you can actually discuss in an interview
- Put strongest skills first in each category
- Remove outdated technologies unless specifically relevant
- Be honest about proficiency levels

## Education

### What to Include
- Degree, Major, University Name
- Graduation date or expected date
- GPA if 3.5+ or top of class
- Relevant coursework if early career (≤2 years experience)
- Academic honors, scholarships

### What to Skip
- High school information (unless no college degree)
- Irrelevant coursework
- GPA below 3.5 (unless required by job posting)

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

### Content Issues
- **Passive language:** "Was responsible for" → "Led/Implemented/Designed"
- **Jargon overload:** Balance technical detail with readability
- **Missing context:** Always explain WHAT you built and WHY it mattered
- **Vague statements:** "Improved performance" → "Reduced latency by 40%"
- **Wall of text:** Bullet points should be 1-2 lines maximum

### Format Issues
- Inconsistent date formats
- Inconsistent bullet point formatting
- Dense paragraphs instead of bullets
- Poor use of white space
- Fancy fonts or colors (stick to professional formatting)

## Role-Specific Guidance

### Junior/Entry-Level (0-2 years)
- Emphasize projects, internships, academic achievements
- Include relevant coursework and personal projects
- Focus on technologies learned and applied
- Quality over quantity - 3-4 strong bullets per role

### Mid-Level (3-6 years)
- Balance technical depth with impact
- Show progression in responsibility
- Highlight collaboration and mentorship
- 4-5 bullets per role focusing on major achievements

### Senior/Staff+ (7+ years)
- Lead with business impact and leadership
- Show system-level thinking and architecture decisions
- Emphasize cross-team collaboration and influence
- Demonstrate technical strategy and vision
- 5-6 bullets per role, highlighting most significant work

## ATS (Applicant Tracking System) Optimization

### Must-Haves
- Standard section headings (Experience, Education, Skills)
- Common job titles (exact match to job posting when possible)
- Keywords from job description naturally integrated
- No headers/footers with critical information
- Simple, clean formatting (no tables, text boxes, or images)

### Keyword Strategy
- Mirror language from job description
- Include both acronyms and full names (e.g., "AWS" and "Amazon Web Services")
- Use industry-standard terms
- Include relevant certifications

## Length Guidelines
- 0-5 years experience: 1 page maximum
- 5-10 years experience: 1-2 pages
- 10+ years experience: 2 pages maximum
- Every word must earn its place

## Tailoring for Specific Roles

### Backend Focus
Emphasize: System design, scalability, databases, API design, performance optimization

### Frontend Focus
Emphasize: User experience, responsive design, performance, accessibility, modern frameworks

### Full-Stack
Balance both frontend and backend, show end-to-end ownership

### DevOps/SRE
Emphasize: Infrastructure automation, reliability, monitoring, incident response, cost optimization

### Engineering Manager
Lead with people management, technical leadership, and business impact. Technical depth second.

## Red Flags to Avoid
- Employment gaps without explanation
- Job hopping (multiple <1 year stints)
- Typos and grammatical errors
- Personal pronouns ("I", "me", "my")
- Unprofessional email addresses
- Photos (in US/Canada resumes)
- Age, marital status, or other personal information
- References ("available upon request" is outdated)
